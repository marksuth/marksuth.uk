I'm Mark, a Web Developer from Leicester, and currently working at CWA Creative Agency.

My interest in the web started I was a kid in the late 90s, when I got a "Build you own Website" book from the School Bookfair, resulting in a number of dodgy looking sites an.

Since then, I've built and worked on a countless amount of websites & app, including an internet radio station, live-streaming my living room for 3 months, setting up a site with a webcam pointed at a garden gnome on top of a wheelie bin to tell how deep the snow was at any given time, along with a large number of somewhat more professional B2B and ecommerce sites and web-apps. 

If you want to get in touch for any reason, feel free to drop me an email mark@marksuth.dev, or give me a follow on Twitter/Linkedin/Instagram etc.
