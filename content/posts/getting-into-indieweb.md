Since first hearing about the IndieWeb movement on a podcast about 10 years ago, I have made a couple of attempts at setting up my own POSSE site, and getting my head round the principles, and tech involved in getting myself setup, and using the IndieWeb and all it has to offer.

However, my previous attempts to getting this kind of site setup have fallen flat, and for various other reasons paired by my online presence. This time however, I have a shiny new domain (marksuth.dev) that feels like going all-in on embracing the IndieWeb is the right move.

As I slowly get myself setup, and settled into all things IndieWeb, I intend to document my adventures, in the hopes of helping a few out along the way.

If nothing else, I'll spend the next couple of weeks smoothing over the rough edges to the site, and see where this goes!
