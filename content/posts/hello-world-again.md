Hi, it's been a while since I've had any form of blog or text of any substance on my site, and decided that now is as good a time as any to try and get back into the habit.

With this latest incarnation, I'm dipping my toe into getting involved in the IndieWeb, which is something that's always intrigued me, and sounded cool, but for one reason or another this site has essentially been a holding page for sometime now.

In addition to getting back into blogging, I'm working on getting this site to function as a POSSE (Publish on your Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere) silo of my posts, comments and general online presence. 

This new effort has kind of been prompted after I registered the .dev version of my domain, treating it as a kind of fresh start to how I go about things, levelling up my skillset as a developer, and possibly even starting to write a few tutorials and guides along the way.

As a pre-cursor to getting this new version of the site setup, I took the chance to have a virtual spring-clean, getting rid of a number of my old, dead side-projects, deleting old accounts I no longer have use for (where possible), and generally tidying up my social profiles.

Hopefully this will remain for more than 5 minutes, and I'll actually do something of value on here, otherwise, it'll be back to a fancy holding page, albeit with some added IndieWeb goodness this time.

Mark
